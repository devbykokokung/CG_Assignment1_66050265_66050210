*READ ME*
1. To run assignment1_66050265_66050210.java. Please compile all files before running.
2. We have CompileAllFile.java for you to compile all files.
3. or if there are old .class files you can remove those and recompile them.

*NOTICE*

I have create 
Vector3D.java 
Object3D.java
BirbPath.java (Similar with G2D)
BirbDraw.java (Separate from BirbPath .. Use to draw polygon like oval circle)
as a library

Sometime when red error appear, it still runnable .. sometime
To run the simulation (in this case is Blackhole Supernova REBORN AS CELESTIAL BEING GOD OF CG) the requirment is to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
and make sure your classpath is set correctly. Also performance of simulation may vary depending on your hardware. So GOOD LUCK

*DETAIL*
Our video is about computer graphics and the simulation of a black hole.
black holes are one of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe.
But this one is special. It represents the ultimate collapse of matter and energy, creating a singularity that warps space and time. At Critical point when took to much object, it will explode into a supernova.And showing the aftermath REBORN of Celestial being. GOD OF CG.

*END*
The simulation is based on various algorithms and techniques from computer graphics, including 3D projection math, particle systems, and more.
So please enjoy the simulation and feel free to modify the code (if u want) as you wish!
